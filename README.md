# Arrhythmia_project
Multiclass classification of cardiac arrhythmia from the ECG recordings

The aim of the work was to implement a machine learning model to classify patients in one of the four classes of cardiac arrhythmias (i.e., normal, ventricular arrhythmia, atrial arrhythmia or ischemia), and therefore to help the diagnosis by the doctor deciding the patient's category. The pipeline included data preprocessing, partition of the dataset, feature selection, cross validation and the final testing with the best model.
